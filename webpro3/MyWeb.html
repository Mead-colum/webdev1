              This game is pretty challenging but it has the best music between the 4 games shown JAZZ. I've been in a jazz band before, unfortunately I had to stop playing as my saxophone was stolen.

              This is a game I've played for a lot of time, however the series I'm relatively new to. You hunt monsters, then you make their materials into weapons to hunt more monsters, simple and fun. I like this games' soundtrack the least out of the four.

              Sonic adventure 2 is a game I enjoyed on my ps3, it has multiple tracks I love with my favorite being "Live and learn". The sonic franchise will always hold a special place in my heart, however second place.
